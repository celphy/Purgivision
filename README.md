# Purgivision
A tool that automatically purges Activisions games from the Battle.net launcher (fow now). As the author I take no responsibility for any
issues that might arise such as your hardware/files/pet/... being damaged or even your Battle.net account being banned.

As this program heavily relies on the https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/StormLib you will need to provide the source code in a folder called Stormlib next to the main.cpp.
In addition to that the StormLibDAD.lib needs to be located as follows ./libs/StormLibDAD.lib.

This is very much work in progress but I want to provide an automatic patcher that removes the Activision games and possibly some adverts from the bloated Battle.net Launcher.
